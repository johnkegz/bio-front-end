In 2007, Fire gutted Budo Junior School and claimed life of 12 Junior Budonians. The incident dragged the school into a period of trauma, leaving it a scene of crime for a period of about 4 years with a fully deployed Anti-Terrorism Police Unit monitoring the premises. The situation put all stakeholders on pressure and stress which made administration shaky as education authority kept changing head teachers in a bid to settle the school again. This situation led to a drastic drop of enrollment from 1300 to 580 children as parents continuously got out their children in fear. Never-the-less, administration had to commit to its budget of especially paying the 147 staff members without laying down any. Here is Ernest Kavulu whose posting to Budo revamped the school back to its glory to see it back to an enrollment of 1400 children with a happy teaching and support staff of 167.
<br/><br/>
Ernest is a born of Busoke – Kalagala Sub County, Bamunanika County in Luweero district to Zakayo and Grace Kunyiga in a family of 8 siblings. His parents were peasant farmers although later the father upgraded to commercial farming.
<br/><br/>
In 1966, he went to Mpigi primary School for his Nursery and primary education which was and is about 2½ Km from their home.  In Primary, he was a footballer, an athlete and a choir member. He attended a day mode of education at Mpigi and used to work in the gardens with his parents over the weekends. When asked about his former school, he says Mpigi was a prominent school of those days that had very committed teachers, well uniformed pupils, streams of different classes, organized and inspiring teachers and above all, a religious culture in learners who went through it. He adds that education of their days was much affiliated to religion and says many children walked miles to come to Mpigi because they were children from Anglican religion while many of their neighbours’ children who were Catholics walked to Natyole R/C Primary and the Moslems went to Busikiri UMEA P/S.
<br/><br/>
Ernest was class monitor in his P4, P5 and P7 during the administrations of the Late Rev George Ssewanonda, late Sebunya and Samuel Kabuye as Headmasters.  
<br/><br/>
He says as Idi Amin took over government while in P3, many people were killed and says this brought trauma among many children who passed by roads with dead bodies.<br/><br/>

He then joined Mpigi SS for his secondary education. He says the secondary life was a bit relaxed and had them attained some freedoms. He says as other students freely walked out of school for lunch, his parents cleared lunch at school and so were not expected to loiter around because of food. Ernest says posho was never a food to them in school. They were fed on Matooke, Cassava and Banana and says that was possible just because schools dealt directly with farmers who came directly to schools to supply food stuffs unlike today with the procurement legalities that require suppliers who hike prices as they look for profits. He says one of his former teachers at Mpigi is Major Jacob Assimwe of the UPDF.
<br/><br/>
Upon completion of S4, Ernest joined Kibuli PTC for Grade II but says only studied it for 2 years because he had the knowledge and was admitted for methodology training. He played Hockey, debated, trained and played Netball and was secretary to the College Students Council. 
<br/><br/>
Ernest says he was being asked to join every school he had been sent to teach during his school practice. However, the principal recommended him to Budo when the late Kigundu former Head teacher of Budo asked the Principal by then Hajji Male for teachers. In 1983, Ernest joined Budo Junior School as a teacher. At Budo, he says children were very eager, clever, and enthusiastic towards learning. He adds that teachers worked hard to satisfy the academic thirst of these very serious pupils. He started teaching from P4 and P5 and says taught all the 4 subjects whenever need arose.
<br/><br/>
He later taught P6 mathematics. Ernest held a number of responsibilities while at Budo among which included, HOD for Science, HOD Kitchen Committee, School Canteen In charge, Dormitory Master, Head Art and Crafts.
<br/><br/>
In 1997, the Head teacher of Kkungu Church of Uganda passed on and Ernest was asked to fill the vacancy as head teacher. Ernest says his posting clearly meant a devastation of his monthly income and many of his friends advised him to decline the posting. He said many of the people in schools of Budo status are in a better state financially than many administrators in challenging schools and so many of his colleagues advised him to decline. He adds his driving force was he was going to Kkungu as the Manager to be reported to unlike Budo where he had to keep reporting to other seniors and so he decided to go as Head teacher.
<br/><br/>
Earnest had in 1986 done his Grade III at Shimon PTC and in 1997 had embarked on his Diploma at Kyambogo. He says unlike Budo, Kkungu was such a challenge as he fell into a school that never minded much about the academic progress of children. He says half way of the children attended school on Market days as parents stopped them from going to school in order to help them sell agricultural products in the market. Worse more he adds that the others who came in the morning could leave in the afternoon on orders of their parents. He said he had to tolerate this but also to sweet talk the parents who in most cases kept a deaf ear about his concerns.
<br/><br/>
He was in 2000 transferred to head Kitegomba Church of Uganda primary School. He however short lived at Kitegomba which was undergoing a reconstruction following a destruction the school had just gone through with the effect of the storm. He only stayed there for about 6 months and was transferred to head Chadwick Namate Primary School Entebbe. 

<br/><br/>
Ernest was at Chadwick school as Headmaster from 2000 June to February 2009 and says the school had many old buildings which were often disturbed by termites, was totally day, with a population of about 1006 children. He put a contribution that had it
Establish a boarding section which Ernest left with around 50 students
Helped lobby government and had the school attain a storeyed staff house that houses 8 teachers.
His administration started to provide teachers with lunch at school unlike many UPE schools which had challenges about the same.
Renovated many school buildings which were in a sorry state especially the floor that had very old tiles
Embarked on remuneration of teachers even those on payroll as a motivation to gear up them for performance. This he says had to negotiate with the local leaders and School Management to have them make a collection of about 10,000/= for the said cause.
He helped Chadwick to improve academically and by the time of his departure, Chadwick was performing better than before.
<br/><br/>
While at Entebbe, Ernest served as Secretary for the Association of Primary Head teachers for 3 years after which he was elected Chairperson for the rest of the 6 years he was at Entebbe. 
<br/><br/>
On 9th February 2009, Ernest was appointed and posted to head Budo Junior which very many onlookers anticipated was on a trial basis since the school had just been in a fire saga and 2 head teachers had been posted and evoked from it within a period of 2 years. This meant earnest had many stakeholders to satisfy in handling Budo among which included the Church as a founding body, Buganda Kingdom, Political leaders, District Authorities, Members of the School Management Committee, Fellow Head teachers who were sympathizers with this great institution, teachers in the school, pupils who had been traumatized, Parents who seemed to be unpredictable, the big number of casual workers with a very small enrollment to accommodate their wages and remuneration, the office of IGG who frequented the institution for endless auditing, the police that labelled Budo Junior a crime scene and stayed for a period of about 4 years. 
<br/><br/>
At Budo, Stephen found a school with a population of about 540 children that was at that time struggling to identify who is who and does what. It had just gone through the fire that left 2 dormitories burnt down and so had no space to keep the children. The school was still confined as a crime scene and under a 24/7 surveillance by security organs. Had to get rehabilitated and renovated but through stages. Had a big staff but not assured of a source to have them paid their wages and salaries and that some could see him as someone who had come on trial. When Ernest was proposed to take over, he says he was sure he could put a stone to Budo since he had earlier worked in it as a teacher for a long time. He says he had gone through the training as a head teacher of very challenging schools and head of other head teachers in Entebbe Municipality, He had experience of administration from the incidental mentorship of Mr. George Kaggwa the former head teacher at Budo under which Ernest had worked. He adds had passed to him a lot of management skills and above all considered the luck of God for his proposal. This made him confident and said within himself, “if not me for Budo, then who was it to face these challenges?” and so decided to face it on him.
<br/><br/>
He adds that his early years of administration were characteristics of finding what others wanted and what should be done visavie the resources available. Working with people many of whom he had worked with and left behind as teachers, and being looked at as a Headmaster was such tense a situation for him at Budo. When he attained office, the school had to re organize as much construction was being done. The storeyed classroom block had to be abandoned for serious rehabilitation by new contractors and engineers and the school faced with rills and gulley erosion. During his stay at Budo, he has improved quite a lot of which some are; 
<br/><br/>
Improved the toilet conditions and built many to the standard that befits the Budo status.<br/><br/>
Increased the number of classrooms by renovating the storeyed classroom block that was considered improper to accommodate class activities by the engineers.<br/><br/>
Removed dust from the school by paving all walk ways which could cause dusty environment whenever it both rained and shined. Paving also solved the gulley erosion from the school which could cause muddy classes when children walked on soil after it had just rained. 
Enlarged the dining hall to accommodate the growing number of children within the school.<br/><br/>
Increased the green squares to not only beautify the environment but also train children neatness of compounds as a life skill.<br/><br/>
Built several teachers’ houses to accommodate many teachers at school and renovated the existing ones including the head teachers’ official residence.
Has furnished the staffroom to make the teachers’ work easier.<br/><br/>
Purchased the school a number of transport facilities among which are the double cabin, a 14 seater shuttle and of recent a bus.<br/><br/>
Embarked on construction of the perimeter wall.<br/><br/>
Installed CCTV cameras to have the school electronically monitored with ease.<br/><br/>
Increased the school population from 540 to 1400 almost tripling the enrollment
<br/><br/>
As an educator above many, he holds other key positions in and out of the profession among which include;<br/><br/>
Secretary for Welfare for Head teachers Association of Wakiso District Primary and elementary School.<br/><br/>
Vice Chairperson for the Church Of Uganda Head teachers Association in Namirembe Diocese<br/><br/>
Chairperson of the Board of the Uganda National Teachers Union SACCO
